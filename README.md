## Prologue

Strong Suit casts you into a bygone era where rogue agents of empires cross paths with myths of lore. Command a party of up to 5 cast-aside heroes, craft your deck from a unique set of cards that reflect real ancient armors and arms, and face off against new enemies each time you explore.

Set in a 1500's archipelago where mythical creatures roam and the empires have abandoned. Each exepidition uncovers new equipment and modifiers to add to your deck, along with rare relics in the form of tarot cards that can drastically change all future runs.

3. Build and refine your deck, choosing new cards and giving them and your party members modifiers.
